            <li>
                <p>1 l water</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>100 g rye bread, dried and toasted (lithuanian bread is strongly recommended)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>50 g sugar</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>1 teaspoon yeast</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <p>Prepare the bread: Cut the rye bread into small pieces and dry them in a toaster oven or a regular oven until they are crispy.</p>
        <p>Boil the water: Bring the water to a boil in a large pot.</p>
        <p>Add the bread: Add the dried bread to the boiling water and let it steep for 15-20 minutes.</p>
        <p>Cool and strain: Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool completely. Strain the liquid to remove the bread pieces.</p>
        <p>Add sugar and yeast: Add sugar and yeast to the cooled liquid. Stir well to dissolve the sugar.</p>
        <p>Fermentation: Transfer the mixture to a clean, sterilized container. Cover the container with a cloth or paper towel and secure it with a rubber band. Let it ferment at room temperature for 1-2 days, or until it becomes bubbly and slightly acidic.</p>
        <p>Bottle and store: Once the fermentation is complete, strain the kvass to remove any sediment. Bottle the kvass and store it in the refrigerator.</p>
